# DataStructures-LinkedList

A linked list is another common data structure that complements the array data structure. Similar to the array, it is also a linear data structure and
stores elements in a linear fashion.

However, unlike the array, it doesnâ€™t store them in contiguous locations; instead, they are scattered everywhere in memory, which is connected to each other using nodes.

A linked list is nothing but a list of nodes where each node contains the value stored and the address of the next node.
